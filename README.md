# Monet-Style-GAN-Creation

## Problem Description

The task is to build a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that generates 7,000 to 10,000 images in the style of Claude Monet. A GAN consists of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates images while the discriminator evaluates them, distinguishing between real and generated images. The competition requires creating Monet-style images from a given dataset.
